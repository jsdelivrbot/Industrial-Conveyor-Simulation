# AutoHotkey Scripts

Just in case you're lost, wondering what the hell these files are:

I created these scripts to use with AutoHotkey software. They are mouse/keyboard macros to do repeated tasks automatically.

For example, ImageSequencerSaver rightclicks the canvas and saves it as an image, then presses a key to "advance the canvas", useful for gifs.
printScreener also helps with gifs but by printing the screen it get things like dom elements and other stuff.

So far, these script only help with gif making.
